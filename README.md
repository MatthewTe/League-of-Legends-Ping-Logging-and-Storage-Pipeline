# League of Legends Ping Logging Application

League of Legends is an online MOBA made by Riot games. Like any online application players connect to the game via servers hosted by Riot games. There are servers across the globe that players can connect to depending on the region in which they play.

The IP addresses for the various servers are as follows:
- NA - 104.160.131.3
- EUW - 104.160.141.3
- EUNE - 104.160.142.3
- OCE - 104.160.156.1
- LAN - 104.160.136.3


This repo contains both the application that logs the ping between the host machine and the league of legend server as well as a ETL pipeline built around the logging application that maintains a database of this timeseries data.
